# SEP4-IoT

This repository is a part of a bigger Semester Project (SEP). It aims at connecting different tiers into a bigger and more complex project. The other two tiers are a Front-end (GUI) and a Back-end (server side).

## Functionalities:
- Measures ambient temperature
- Measures air humidity
- Surveils the room for movement
- Sends data over TCP to the back-end
- Turn on and off the surveillance system using a PIN code
- Change PIN code

## Compatability 
The project is created with the 8-bit AVR ATmega 2560 Microcontroller in mind but can be built using PlatformIO for any other board

## Instalation 
Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

```bash
ext install platformio.platformio-ide
```

or download and install as VSIX from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide)
